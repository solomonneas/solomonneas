## 🛠️ Solomon Neas

**Network & Systems Engineer | MS Candidate @ USF | Solutions Architect**

### 👋 Welcome
I’m a Network and Systems Engineering professional building at the intersection of infrastructure, security intelligence, and automation. I manage enterprise labs by day and architect custom software solutions by night.

### 🌐 The Journey (1999–Present)
*You might ask why an 8-year-old account is only recently seeing daily commits:*
* 💾 **The Origin (1999):** I started in the era of broken `<frameset>` tags and the chaotic DIY glory of **Angelfire** and **Geocities**. I remember thinking **PHP** was the coolest thing ever because it finally made the web feel "alive."
* 🔪 **The Culinary Pivot:** I spent 17 years in the culinary industry—managing high-stakes, high-pressure environments that taught me more about "systems," "workflow optimization," and "uptime" than any textbook could.
* 🎓 **The Return & Education:** 5 years ago, I returned to my roots. I’ve spent that time stacking credentials and real-world experience:
    * 📜 **AS** in Network Systems Engineering Technology
    * 📜 **BAS** in Supervision and Management
    * 🤘 **MS in Cybersecurity Intelligence & Information Security** (Current @ University of South Florida)

### 🧪 What I'm Building
* 📋 **Lab Inventory Manager:** A full-stack **FastAPI/Astro** engine that aggregates live hardware data from **Netdisco** and **LibreNMS** for real-time asset tracking.
* 💻 **Terminal Portfolio:** A minimalist, CLI-inspired personal site (built with **Astro/React**) designed to mimic a Linux shell environment.
* ⚙️ **Automation Engine:** Custom Python and Bash tools for enterprise hardware lifecycle management and SNMP discovery.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
* 🐍 **Languages:** Python (FastAPI, SQLAlchemy), JavaScript (Astro, Node.js), SQL.
* 🛣️ **Infrastructure:** Cisco Networking, Dell Enterprise Systems (PowerEdge), VMware/Proxmox.
* 🐳 **Management:** Netdisco, LibreNMS, Docker, Linux (Debian/Enterprise flavors).
